# CDG Custom Child Theme

A streamlined Divi child theme focused exclusively on Divi-specific functionality. WordPress core optimizations, security hardening, and agency features are handled by the **CDG Core plugin**.

## Version 2.3.2

### Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 8.0+
- Divi 5 (standard across all CDG sites)
- **CDG Core plugin** (recommended for full functionality)

### Architecture

This child theme follows a separation of concerns principle:

| Component              | Location                           | Responsibility                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **CDG Child Theme**    | `/wp-content/themes/cdg-custom/`   | Divi-specific functionality               |
| **CDG Core plugin**    | `/wp-content/plugins/cdg-core/`    | WordPress optimizations & agency features (managed via ManageWP) |
| **SpinupWP**           | Server level                       | Caching, performance, security headers    |

## Features

### ACF Local JSON

The theme automatically configures ACF Pro to save and load field groups from the `acf-json/` directory.

This enables:

- Version control for field groups
- Faster field group loading
- Easy deployment across environments
- Field group editing in wp-admin without requiring a developer

### Subfooter CSS Classes

The theme provides two CSS classes for footer copyright text:

- `.cdg-subfooter-info-light` - Dark text for light backgrounds
- `.cdg-subfooter-info-dark` - Light text for dark backgrounds

These automatically append the site title and "All Rights Reserved" text using CSS `::after` pseudo-elements.

**Usage in Divi:**
Add a Code module with an empty `<span>` element:

```html
<span class="cdg-subfooter-info-light">© 2025</span>
```

**Customization via CSS variables:**

```css
:root {
  --cdg-subfooter-color-light: #333;
  --cdg-subfooter-color-dark: #f4f4f4;
  --cdg-subfooter-font-size: 1em;
  --cdg-subfooter-font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Divi 5 Standard

CDG now builds exclusively on Divi 5. The theme validates that the Divi parent theme is installed, and displays the detected Divi version on the status page for reference — no version comparison or Divi 4/5 branching logic is performed.

## Admin Status Page

View theme status at **Tools → CDG Theme Status**, which displays:

- Theme version
- Divi version
- PHP and WordPress versions
- CDG Core plugin status

## Changelog

### 2.3.2

- **Fixed the child theme stylesheet loading twice.** `style.css` was being requested by Divi and again by the theme's own enqueue, because the theme enqueued its styles after Divi had already checked (priority 10). Styles now enqueue at priority 5, so Divi sees the child stylesheet is already handled and skips its own copy. No visual change; one fewer request per page.
### 2.3.1

- **Updated CDG Core references from mu-plugin to standard plugin** — CDG Core is now installed at `/wp-content/plugins/cdg-core/` (managed via ManageWP) rather than as a must-use plugin. Updated `style.css`, `functions.php`, `class-cdg-theme.php`, and this README to reflect the new install path.
- **Added CDG Core detection notice** — `functions.php` now shows a dismissible admin notice (visible to administrators only) when the CDG Core plugin isn't active, reusing the existing `CDG_CORE_VERSION` check. Non-blocking — the theme still initializes normally, since CDG Core is recommended, not required.

### 2.3.0

- **Standardized on Divi 5** — CDG now builds exclusively on Divi 5, so all Divi-version-comparison logic has been removed as unnecessary:
  - Removed the `4.0` minimum-version check (and its `RuntimeException`) from the `after_setup_theme` initialization callback in `functions.php`. Only Divi parent theme existence is now validated.
  - Removed the `is_divi_5` property and `is_divi_5()` method from `CDG_Theme`.
  - Simplified `detect_divi_version()` to record the Divi version string for display purposes only — no comparison logic.
  - Removed the Divi-version warning block from `check_compatibility()`; it now checks PHP version only.
  - Removed the "Divi 5 Detected" row from the Tools → CDG Theme Status admin page.
- **Removed duplicate `phpcs:ignore` comment** in `CDG_Theme::is_builder_active()` — the nonce-verification suppression was declared on two adjacent lines; consolidated to one.

### 2.2.0

- **Replaced autoloader with explicit requires** — Removed `spl_autoload_register` that was triggering filesystem checks (`file_exists`) on every class PHP resolved. Divi 5's larger class footprint made this a measurable memory overhead on every request. The three theme classes are now loaded via direct `require_once` calls.
- **Removed unverified Divi 5 hooks** — Removed `init_divi_5_features()` and its four placeholder hook registrations (`et_builder_load_requests`, `et_builder_modules_loaded`, `et_core_page_resource_hints`, `et_builder_ready`) plus five empty/pass-through callback methods. These Divi 4 builder hooks may not exist or may behave differently in Divi 5's rewritten architecture. Also removed `et_builder_module_performance` filter from `CDG_Optimizations`.
- **Removed unverified Divi 5 theme support flags** — Removed `add_theme_support('et-builder-5')` and `add_theme_support('et-builder-performance')` which are not documented in Divi 5's official resources.
- **Consolidated `after_setup_theme` callbacks** — Reduced from four callbacks (priorities 5, 10, 15, 20) to three (5, 10, 15). Moved block editor theme support (`editor-styles`, `align-wide`, `custom-line-height`, `custom-units`) into `CDG_Theme::theme_setup()`. Eliminated duplicate `responsive-embeds` declaration.
- **Fixed Divi version detection** — Changed primary detection source from `ET_CORE_VERSION` to `wp_get_theme('Divi')->get('Version')`. In Divi 5, ET Core is architecturally separate and its version may not match the theme version. `ET_CORE_VERSION` is retained as a fallback only.
- **Removed duplicate generator filter** — Removed `the_generator` filter from theme (already handled by CDG Core's cleanup class when `remove_wp_version` is enabled).
- **Updated admin status page** — Changed "Divi 5 Support" label to "Divi 5 Detected" to accurately reflect informational status.
